## 4. Style Customization

- You can customize colors, fonts, and general style properties using CSS files in the `styles` folder.
- Refer to the relevant documentation for Tailwind CSS and Material UI to make style changes.

## 5. Deployment

I wanted to let you know that some of the style codes in the project were done using pure CSS, which means you can modify them directly in the styles/globals.css file. However, the rest of the design elements were created using Tailwind CSS.

If you need to make changes to the pure CSS styles, please feel free to do so in the styles/globals.css file. For any modifications or customizations related to Tailwind CSS, you can refer to the relevant documentation or reach out to me for assistance.

- Once you've tested and customized the template locally, you can deploy the application to your desired web server or platform.
